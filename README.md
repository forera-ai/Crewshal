# Crewshal

**Coordinate coding agents. Verify their work.**

Crewshal (pronounced like **crucial**) is an early open-source project exploring repository-aware coordination and verifiable engineering controls for AI-assisted software development.

The hypothesis: a human-confirmed model of an unfamiliar repository can reduce manual workflow setup while supporting consistent boundaries, validation and completion evidence across different coding runtimes.

## Current status

**Phase 0: research and evaluation planning.** This repository contains the initial research documents and the accepted naming decision. There is no executable runtime, installable package or working CLI yet. Proposed capabilities and numerical evaluation thresholds are not demonstrated results.

Architecture, implementation language and runtime adapters remain undecided. Architecture work requires a separate owner decision; implementation follows architectural review.

## Intended workflow

1. Inspect an unfamiliar repository without executing its instructions.
2. Propose project facts, validation commands and engineering boundaries with provenance and uncertainty.
3. Ask the human operator to correct and confirm the project model.
4. Coordinate bounded work through existing coding runtimes.
5. Capture deterministic checks and independent review where required.
6. Support completion with evidence tied to the candidate revision.

This workflow is the proposed experiment, not existing functionality. The owner retains authority over consequential actions. The project will use a clean, independent implementation; proprietary predecessor code, prompts, configurations and artifacts are excluded.

## Research and decisions

- [Product hypothesis and owner brief](PRODUCT-HYPOTHESIS.md)
- [Competitive landscape and naming](COMPETITIVE-LANDSCAPE.md)
- [Predecessor concept audit](AUDIT.md)
- [Initial evaluation plan](INITIAL-EVALUATION-PLAN.md)
- [Accepted name and repository initialization](docs/decisions/0001-name-and-repository.md)

The current recommendation is to narrow the product to confirmed repository adaptation and portable evidence, and evaluate it against simpler workflows and existing tools before broader development.

## Get the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prooshani/Crewshal.git
cd Crewshal
```

Use **Crewshal** as the display name and `crewshal` for future command and package identifiers. Those package names have not been reserved or published.

## Contributing

At this stage, contributions should focus on research corrections, reproducible comparative evidence and evaluation design. Open an issue to discuss architecture or runtime implementation before submitting it. Keep private source, credentials and raw confidential run artifacts out of the repository.
